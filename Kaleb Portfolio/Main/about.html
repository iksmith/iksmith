            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Hello World. I'm Kaleb, a passionate self-taught <span><b>Fullstack Developer</b></span> with a thrill for creative platforms and gaming. With over 8 years of hands-on project management experience, I've honed my organizational and leadership skills to a tee. My journey in the world of technology began with a curiosity that turned into a full-blown passion. <br>

                In addition to my developer prowess, I'm a former startup founder. This entrepreneurial journey has given me invaluable insights into creating simple, effective solutions for everyday problems. I thrive on identifying challenges and crafting elegant, user-friendly solutions that make life easier for others. <br>
                    
                When I'm not immersed in code or brainstorming innovative solutions, you can usually find me exploring the latest video games or engaging with creative communities. I'm a firm believer that the best developers are those who balance technical expertise with a keen sense of creativity and an eye for detail. <br>
                    
                I'm excited to share my projects, experiences, and the things that inspire me with you. Feel free to explore my portfolio and <a href="mailto:kalebjsmith@yahoo.com?body=Hello, Kaleb!&subject=KS Portfolio - " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="say-hello">"Say Hello üëã"</a> if you want to collaborate or simply geek out about the latest developments in tech and gaming. <br>
                    
                Let's build something amazing together!
